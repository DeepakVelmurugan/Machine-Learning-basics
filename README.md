# Intro to Machine Learning
**This repo contains all the basic algorithms involved in machine learning from supervised to unsupervised learning**

*Brief disclaimer: The following code is in octave, it is recommended to have a basic knowledge of it or MATLAB before going through the code.*

## List of topics:

1. [Linear regression](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/Housing%20prices%20Linear%20Regression)
2. [Logistic regression](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/Logistic_regression)
3. [Neural networks](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/Handwritten_digits_recognition)
4. [Support vector machine](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/SVM_and_EmailClassifier)
5. [PCA and k-means](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/PCA_and_K-means)
6. [Anomaly detection and Collaborative filtering](https://github.com/DeepakVelmurugan/machineLearning/tree/master/AnomalyDetection_and_CollaborativeFiltering)
